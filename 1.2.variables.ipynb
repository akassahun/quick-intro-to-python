    "# Variables and assignment statements\n",
    "\n",
    "To manipulate climate data, such as converting the temprature given in a tenth of degrees centigrades (24 &#8530;&deg;C) to just degrees centigrades (2.4&deg;C) we must first store the original value (24) and convert it and assign it again to a variable (so that we can use it later on). How do we store values?  \n",
    "\n",
    "> *A **variable** is symbolic name (a label, an identifier), which is used to refer to a data item. (A variable is like a name: it will be difficult for us to refer to each other if we did not have names.) The data type of a variable in python is determined by the data value it refers to.*\n",
    "\n",
    "> *A **statement** is a command formulated using variables, operators, etc. (comparable to a sentence in English language) that expresses an action to be carried out.* \n",
    "\n",
    "> *An **assignment statement** is a statement that stores a value in a variable. An assignment statement contains a variable (sometimes more than one variable) followed by an equal sign (=), followed by an expression. The variable 'receives' the value computed by the expression. The equal sign is called an **assignment operator**.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules for variable names\n",
    "We all have names, and there are certain rules that apply to our (human) names. For instance, names like Jane or John are acceptable, but not not x2000. There are also rules for valid variable names. \n",
    "> A  valid python variable name may contain a string of uppercase and lowercase letters (a..z and A..Z), an underscore (_), and, except for the first character, digits (0..9).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, `x2000` is a valid variable name. `2000x` is not a valid variable name because it starts with a digit. `x 2000` is also not a valid variable name because it contains a space (between the letter x and the digit 2).  \n",
