    "As in mathematics, programming languages differentiate between data types. In math, there are many types of numbers, such as natural numbers, integers, real numbers, decimal numbers, complex numbers, binary numbers, etc. In Python there are four numerical data types: `int`, `float`, `long`, `complex` (fortunately, far limited than in maths).\n",

    "* `int` represents integers. In maths, an integer is infinite. In python the largest positive and negative `int` values are limited by the memory space the computer reserves for `int` values. In a 32 bits computer systems the minimum `int` value is –2<sup>31</sup> and the maximum `int` value is 2<sup>31</sup>-1; in a 64 bits computer systems the minimum `int` value is –2<sup>63</sup> and the maximum `int` value is 2<sup>63</sup>-1.\n",

    "Entering numbers into computers is of limited use unless we do some computation with them. To compute we need operators. In python several operators are defined, which can be grouped into *numerical*, *comparison* and *boolean* operators. Below are the most common numerical opertors:\n",

    "----:|---\n",
    "`+`  | Addition: arithmetic “plus”  \t\n",
    "`-`  | Subtraction: arithmetic “minus” \n",
    "`*`  | Multiplication: arithmetic “times”. Note that the sign star “*” is used instead of the standard multiplication sign (×) for the sake of legibility.\n",
    "`/`  | Floor division: arithmetic “divide” that rounds down (cuts of the part after the period). Note the forward slash is used instead of the division sign (&divide;) for the sake of simplifying coding. (There is no &divide; key on the keyboard!).\n",
    "`%`\t | Remainder: the remainder after integer division: a % b = (a / b – a // b) * b. For example, 5 % 3 = 2.\n",
    "`**` | Exponentiation: arithmetic “to the power”: a `**` b is “a to the power b. Note that two stars (`**`) are used instead of <sup>superscripting</sup>, again for the sake of simplifying coding. For example, 2 `**` 3 = 8.\n",
